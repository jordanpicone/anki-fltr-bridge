# anki-fltr-bridge
Synchronizes vocabulary between Anki and FLTR

Anki-FLTR bridge combines the strengths of two popular open-source language learning programs. FLTR is used to read texts in foreign languages and save words to a vocabulary list. However, FLTR lacks a spaced-repetition system to study these cards. Anki-FLTR bridge automatically creates Anki cards from words added via FLTR and updates the learner's knowledge of each word in FLTR based on the anki study interval.

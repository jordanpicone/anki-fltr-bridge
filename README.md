Synchronizes vocabulary between Anki and FLTR

Anki-FLTR bridge combines the strengths of two popular open-source language learning programs. FLTR is used to read texts in foreign languages and save words to a vocabulary list. However, FLTR lacks a spaced-repetition system to study these cards. Anki-FLTR bridge automatically creates Anki cards from words added via FLTR and updates the learner's knowledge of each word in FLTR based on the anki study interval.

This program requires the [AnkiConnect] (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on. 

Edit config.json and provide the path to your FLTR vocab and the name of your Anki deck
